Deploying a Web Application on AWS: An Overview
AWS offers a variety of services that can be used to deploy web applications. The choice of services depends on factors like application size, complexity, scalability requirements, and desired level of control. Here's a general overview of common deployment strategies:

1. Elastic Beanstalk:
Managed service: Handles infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and patching.
Supports multiple environments: Development, staging, and production.
Easy to use: Simple interface for deploying applications.
Suitable for: Small to medium-sized applications with standard deployment patterns.
2. EC2:
More control: Allows you to manage servers directly.
Flexible: Can be used for various deployment architectures.
Requires more management: Need to handle patching, scaling, and security.
Suitable for: Larger applications with complex requirements or specific infrastructure needs.
3. Serverless Architecture:
Lambda: Executes code without managing servers.
API Gateway: Handles HTTP requests.
DynamoDB: Provides NoSQL database.
S3: Stores static content.
Suitable for: Applications that can be decomposed into smaller, event-driven functions.
4. Containerization (ECS, EKS):
Packages applications into containers: Encapsulates dependencies and environment.
ECS: Managed container service.
EKS: Kubernetes-based container service.
Suitable for: Applications that require flexibility, scalability, and efficient resource utilization.
